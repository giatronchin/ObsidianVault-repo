#Bash is a shell that is present in most Linux based distros.

Check which shell you are actually using in your terminal:

	echo $SHELL ---> Return location for that shell

Usually binary is inside **/usr/bin/bash**.

--------------------------------------------------
To build a script:

1. Create a file were you will place the commands you want to execute
2. Change the permission over the file so that your user can execute it

	chmod +x filename.sh

3. ShaBang - @top of the file, tell the terminal with binary use to execute the following

	#!/bin/bash
	#!/usr/bin/python
