#Bash is a shell that is present in most Linux based distros.

Check which shell you are actually using in your terminal:

	echo $SHELL ---> Return location for that shell

Usually binary is inside **/usr/bin/bash**.

--------------------------------------------------
To build a script:

1. Create a file were you will place the commands you want to execute
2. Change the permission over the file so that your user can execute it
```bash
chmod +x filename.sh
```
3. ShaBang - @top of the file, tell the terminal with binary of the interpreter to be used in the following (find out the absolute path with _which_ command)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/bin/python
```
4. List all commads
5. Execute the script
```bash
./script-filename.sh
```
--------------------------------------------------
## Variables

```bash
variableName="Something" #Declaration

echo $variableName #Print(Recall) variable content
```

```bash
myname="Gigi"

echo "Ciao il mio nome è $myname" #Will print "Ciao il mio nome è Gigi"
echo 'Ciao il mio nome è $myname' #Will print "Ciao il mio nome è $myname"
```

```bash
echo 'Questo è come stampare l\'apostrofo ' #The escape character \ allow us to use single-quotes string 
```

**Note**: Variable declaration is tied with the specific session. They don't persist once the specific shell they where created initially is closed.

### Grab output of a command

Throw the output of the 'ls' command inside the files variable. This levarage a **sub-shell** where the list storage command is executed (in the background) and the output piped as the variable content.

```bash
files=$(ls)
```
--------------------------------------------------

## Math
Need to specify bash that we want to 'evaluate' an expression.

```bash
expr 30 + 10 #30
expr 30 / 10 #3
expr 30 \* 10 #300

mynum=100

expr mynum + 50 #150
```
--------------------------------------------------

## If-Else

Note: _Spacing is very important for the syntax of the if-else statement_
```bash
#!/bin/bash

mynum=200

if [ $mynum -eq 200 ] # -eq expression evaluation "equal to"
then
	echo "The condition is true."
else
	echo "The variable does not equal 200"
fi

```
Check for the presence of a file in the filesystem:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -f ~/myfile ]
then
	echo "The file exists."
else
	echo "The file does not exists."
fi

```
Check if htop is installed, otherwise install it, and run it:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

command=/usr/bin/htop

if [ -f $command ]
then
	echo "$command is available, let's run it."
else
	echo "$command is NOT available, installing it..."
	sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y htop 
	# && awaits for the succesful execution of the first portion and then execute the second part
fi

$command

```
Better version:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

command=htop

if command -v $command #check for the exist of the command within the $command
then
	echo "$command is available, let's run it."
else
	echo "$command is NOT available, installing it..."
	sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y htop 
	# && awaits for the succesful execution of the first portion and then execute the second part
fi

$command

```
