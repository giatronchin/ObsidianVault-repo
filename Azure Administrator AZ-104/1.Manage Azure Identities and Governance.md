# Manage Microsoft ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) Objects

==Microsoft ID==/**Azure AD**: Azure **Active Directory**

## Generics
Azure AD is multi-tenant
- All customers (tenants) are in one huge directory
- Your tenant is private to you
Azure AD is primarily and *identity management directory*
- Mostly used for user login authentication
- Azure resources are secured using Azure AD accounts
Azure AD is a *trusted provider*
- Uses internet security protocols: OpenID, OAuth, SAML
- Can simplify single sign-on (SSO) for cloud apps
Can synchronize with on-prem Active Directory Domain Services (**AD DS**)

---
### Azure AD Custom Domains
Before adding users, add Custom Domains:
- these are domains you own
- you must add an entry to DNS zone to **prove ownership**
User IDs can the end in that domain:
- Default domain is `jacklab.onmicrosoft.com` but since I own `jacklab.dev` I can use something like e.g `giacomino@jacklab.dev`
### Azure AD Users
Add **User** account for employees
- Choose a domain suffix from custom domains
- Set properties as desired
Add **Guest** accounts for *non-employees*
- They are sent an email  invitation
- Guests can belong to any security role
### Azure AD Groups
Add **Group** account to organize users by department, job title, etc.
- Users and Guests can be in multiple groups
- Resource access can be assigned to Users and Groups
- Each Group has an owner who can change the membership to a group (for Security Groups)

**Group Type**
- ==Security Groups== - used to secure resources (you can add users, groups, devices as *members*)
	- *assignment* can be **static** or **dynamic**
- ==Microsoft 365 Groups== - used for shared mailbox, calendar and SharePoint collection, etc.

### Group Membership Types
1. **Assigned** - admins specifically add users and groups (static)
2. **Dynamic User** or **Dynamic Device** - requires Azure AD Premium P1 (==paid subscription==)
	- Membership is assigned automatically based on attributes (such as User, Device). When attributes change dynamic groups are evaluated for changes.
	- Can costruc complex rule that evaluates up to 5 attributes

---
### Perform Bulk User Operations
Bulk create user account
- Download CSV template from portal
- User portal to add users from CSV file
Other bulk operation for users:
- **Invite** (guest), **delete**, **download**
Bulk Operation for group accounts:
- **Import**, **Remove**, **Download** members
- ==There is no bulk create for *groups*==

### Azure AD Devices
**Devices Identities** are *object* in Azure AD
- Computers (mobile, tablet, PC) from which a user authenticates to Azure AD
- Properties about the device facilitate control

### Azure AD Device Join Types
| **Registred**                            | **Joined**                                                                | **Hybrid Joined**        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Win10, iOS, Android, macOS               | Windows 10 (not Home)                                                     | Windows 10, 8.1, 7       |
| **User owned** or **Organization owned** | Organization owned                                                        | Organization owned       |
| SSO to cloud                             | SSO to cloud and on-prem (*this second goes either way through Azure AD*) | SSO to cloud and on-prem |

Scenario example:
- **Registred Devices**
	- Consultant needs access to org. resources from their computer
	- User accesses email from personal phone that is not compliant
- **Joined Devices**
	- Orgs that don't have on-prem Windows AD
	- Users primarily need access MS 365 cloud apps
- Hybrid Joined Devices
	- You have Windows 8.1 or 7 deployed
	- You want to manage devices through **Windows AD Group Policy**

### Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)
- Manages Azure AD password change for users
- Azure AD Premium P1 feature (==subscription to P1 required==)
- Enable for all or specific groups
- Indicate which kinds of identification required for change (user has to prove their identity)
	- Email, mobile phone, security questions
	- Users must register their contact info or have it synched from on-prem AD
- On-prem Active Directory integration
	- ==Azure AD Connect Password Writeback== must be **enabled**
	- Enable or disable writeback in SSPR settings
	- Some orgs choose not to configure SSPR for this reason

### Azure Resource Hierarchy

*Resource* - something you create with Azure portal, powershell, CLI (like VM, database, etc).
- Resource belongs to exactly **one Resource Group**
- **Resource Group** is a *logical* collection of resources
	- resources from any region (a group is not related to a single region)
- **Subscription** contains *resource groups*
	- billing occurs at this level
- **Management Group** is a hierarchy of Subscriptions
	- useful for larger orgs with many Subscriptions (for example one for each department with its own budget)

### Manage Resource Permissions
- Simplify security with this hierarchy
	- Permission are set at any level of the hierarchy
	- Permission are inherited down the hierarchy
- Set permission at the highest level possible to simplify administration
	- Design hierarchy before creating resources
	- Most resources can be moved, but plan ahead

### Configure RBAC Role Assignments
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) authorizes every request to access resources in Azure
- ==Assign **roles** to Azure AD users and groups for access==
- Three general roles:
	- **Owner** - can perform any change to resource
	- **Contributor** - can perform any change except role change
	- **Reader** - cannot modify resource
- Dozen of built-in roles specific to resources
- Can create your own custom roles

### Create Custom RBCA role
- Stored as JSON file
- To create a new role
	- start with a *similar role (predefined)*
	- modify permissions
	- assign scope (*resource group* or a *subscription*)
	- choose descriptive name
- *Management Plane* Permissions
	- Action, NotAction: administer the resource (*what the role will allow to do and what not*)
- *Data Plan* Permissions
	- DataAction, NotDataAction: access date in the resource (*for example data within a blob*)
